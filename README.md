# To-Do List

A To-Do App build with React.js and Redux and using Material UI.

This application provides an opportunity to split your todos into categories. Categories can be nested inside each other and have an infinite hierarchy.
When you click on category you will see its todos. Also you can add, change or delete category.
There is a propgress bar which shows what percentage of the categories are done. Completed category is a category in which all tasks are done or if itâ€™s empty.
